This Project teaches students to build a structured HTML5 webpage using semantic elements like <header>, <main>, and <footer>. Students create a contact form with built-in validation (required fields, email format, and min-length checks) and validate their code using the W3C Validator. The lab requires VS Code, a modern browser, Git, and GitHub for setup. Tasks include writing HTML5 markup, adding a navigation menu, and organizing content with <section> and <aside>. Finally, students push their project to GitHub for submission, learning version control basics. The 2-hour lab reinforces web development best practices, including accessibility and code validation.
